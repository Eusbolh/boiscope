## Simple Snake Game with JavaScript

* Big part of code is copied from the Youtube Channel Chris DeLeon of Gamkedo's "[Coding "Snake" in 4 min 30 sec (plain browser JavaScript)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs)"

* I'm trying to improve to code and fix the bugs for just fun, feel free to contribute!

### TO-DO

* Code can generate new baits on the snake's tail. I believe this is not the desired behaviour.

* Normally, code does not allow you to change your direction to opposite direction. However, if you can push the key fast enough (e.g. while snake is moving to right, push the keys up and left in order), snake can move to opposite direction.
