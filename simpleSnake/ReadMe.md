## Simple Snake Game with JavaScript

* Big part of code is copied from the Youtube Channel Chris DeLeon of Gamkedo's "[Coding "Snake" in 4 min 30 sec (plain browser JavaScript)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs)"

* I'm trying to improve to code and fix the bugs for just fun, feel free to contribute!

### BUGS

* Scorejumps - reason is unidentified
    - I think I solved the scorejump problem. It seems like the problem was not about actual scorejumps, instead the problem was about not resetting the score after a death.
* New baits on tail - reason is unidentified
