* Big part of code is copied from the Youtube Channel Chris DeLeon of Gamkedo's "[Coding "Snake" in 4 min 30 sec (plain browser JavaScript)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs)"

* I'm trying to improve to code and fix the bugs for just fun, feel free to contribute!

### BUGS

* Scorejumps - reason is unidentified
    - I think I solved the scorejump problem. It seems like the problem was not about actual scorejumps, instead the problem was about not resetting the score after a death.
* New baits on tail - reason is unidentified

### Captain's Log
[07.06] When user press the space button -which is assigned for pause-, there will be the sentence "Paused" in the middle of the game screen.
    - There still exist a problem for middling the sentence, I fixed it by coordinates, but it still needs an adjustment or complete solutiion.
[07.06] Canvas is centered. It happened with actually in a weird way. I didn't think "text-align" style method would work for this problem. Whatever.. It's solved. Maybe I can look for a better solution.
